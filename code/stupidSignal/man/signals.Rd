it.}

\description{
Several different signals built on \code{message}, \code{warning} and
\code{stop} to facilitate various signals you could throw in your scripts
or pipelines.
}
\details{
Most signals are build from signal text, which is first colored and then
passed to \code{message}, \code{warning} or \code{stop}.
By default, errors and warnings are
light red while messages are light blue. Finally, errors and warnings
enable logging their respective text, but you can also use \code{logme}
for logging other useful texts or variable states.

\code{info} is just colored \code{message} without any other secondary effect.

\code{warn} is colored \code{warning}, without call and with immediate
effect. It has secondary effect by setting global variable
\code{.warning_occurred}, which can be later used to throw \code{stop}
signal.

\code{warning_occurred} returns TRUE if variable \code{.warning_occurred}
exist and its true.

\code{stop_if_warn} throw \code{stop} signal if warning occurred. This signal
is treated similarly to \code{quit} signal with respect to R quiting with
error (e.g., GNU make will recognize it as error and stops).

\code{pass} just prints word "pass" in light green. So you or users of your
scripts can be calm and happy.

\code{logme} will log text to previously initialized log file.

\code{log_init} will initialize log file and save this name into global
variable \code{.log_file}.

\code{error} will print colored message and throw \code{stop} signal.

\examples{
# You could use signals as this:
do_something = function(){
    # inform what function is doing
    info("I am doing something")
    # some critical behaviour which you could test:
    if(1 == 2){
        # inform about error
        warn("We might have an error here")
        # do something else, for example log current values of parameters
        }
    # throw error if warning occurred
    stop_if_warn()
    }

do_something()
